# Computer Science Club curriculum
As the acting leader of GreatChina computer science club, I have the responsibility to prepare for the curriculum and ensure every club member in the club can actually learn something from our club course.  
In that case, I update part of the documents that are used previously and in the future here in this repo.  
I sincerely welcome club members to check for infomation here and give me suggestions about courses by creating an [ISSUE](https://github.com/EULIR/Computer-Science-Club-curriculum/issues).
